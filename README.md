This library uses Puppeteer to simulate going to browser & saving the data to SQlite.
However, taken into account the number of links & results here, it doesn't make sense to use this since it's going to take a long time.
Please refer to the new repository instead where we did some reverse engineering to make the process much more faster: https://github.com/terryds/pemilu-2024-scraper-kpu
